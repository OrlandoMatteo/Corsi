## Emphirical method

Find an explanation from an observation :arrow_forward: formulate a theory :arrow_forward: Formulate and hypotesis :arrow_forward: Test it.

We will focus on how to test the hypotesis.
The threatment is and independent variable that produce an outcume after it's processed, each outcome depends the correspondent input variable.
The *Construct* is an abastract concept that indicates the object of the study. The *Variable* is the parameter, we must give a definition of it and measure it. There *Dependent variable* is the output the process while the *Indipendent variable* is the input of the process. The *Factor* in an input variable that has an effect on the output we want to study. The *Treatment* is a particular value of a factor. The *Subject* perform a *task* with an *object*. THe *Trial* is a combination of subject-task-object, usually an experiment consist in several trials.

## Example

### Assessing the effect of mockup in the comprehension of functional requirements

**Definition** :arrow_forward: **Planning** :arrow_forward: **Operation** :arrow_forward: **Analysis & interpretation** :arrow_forward: **Presentation & package** :arrow_forward: **Conclusion** :arrow_forward:

### Definition

We've to describe what we're doing and why, at this level the hypotesis should be clear but not formally described. One method to do this is the **Goal Question Metric (GQM)**: from a ***goal*** i try to genereate multiple ***question*** and calculate the ***metrics*** for each of them.
Analyze the **object** for the **purpose** with respect to their ****quality*** focus* with a given perspective in a **context**. Once this template is completed we can create the **Research question**, and we can refine the goal to a more operational level

### Planning

**Context selection** :arrow_forward: Hypotesis formulation :arrow_forward: Variables selection :arrow_forward: Subjects selection :arrow_forward: Experiment design :arrow_forward: Instrumentation :arrow_forward: Validity Evaluation :arrow_forward: **Experiment Design**

#### Context selection

The context of experiment can be characterized according to 4 dimensions:

- Offline vs. Online
- Student vs. Professionals
- Toy vs. Real
- Specific vs. General

#### Hypotesis formulation

Two kind of hypotesis can be formalized: the **Null Hypotesis** and **True Hypotesis**.  

#### Variable selection

We need to select wich are the independent variable that we can control and the dependent variable that we can measure after the treatment.  

#### Subject selection

Subjects are selected from a population, the sampling can be a : *Probability* sampling (simple random, sytematic etc.) or *Non-probability* sampling (convenience, quota). Some general principle are:

- The larger the variation of the population is the larger is the sample size needed
- Analysis of data may influence the sample size choice we need to consider how to analyze data since the design stage

#### Experiment design

An experiment consists in a series of trials, design and interpretation are closely realated: the design choices can strongly impact the analysis.  
*Randomization* can be used to aveage the effects of the factor that may otherwise be present. *Blocking* is used to eliminate undesired effect of a factor that we are not interested in. An experiment design is *balanced* where each treatment has an equal number of subjects.
Typical 1 factor and 2 treatment technique is used, each sucject is randomly assigned to one of the two treatments. The number of treatments can be greater than 2

#### Instrumentation

THe goal of instrumentation is to provide means to perform experiments and monitor it without affecting the control of the experiment. We've thre times of instruments....

#### Validity Evaluaziton

Threats to valididy are limitations to the adequate validity, there are different possible threats:

- External  
  Can the result of the study been generalized?  
- Construct  
  Threats related to issued related to the relationship
- Internal  
  Threats concerning issues that can indicate  acasual relationship where there is none
- Conclusion  
  Threats concerning the statistical issues that can affect the draw of the correct conclusion

We can rank the different test according if we're testing a theory or we are making an applied research

#### Operation

The **Preparation** can have two maun issues: *Ethical issuses* (professionals,students), *Privacy*.

### Analysis & interpretation

Descriptive statistic:

- Distribution
- Tendency
- Dispersion
- Visualization

Sometimes we need to reduce the data before we can test our hypotesis.  
Two possible error can be made:

- **Type 1** Assert the presence of a pattern when there's not
- **Type2** Not noticing the presence of a pattern when thers's one

The  **Power** of the test is the probability that a test revelas a true pattern if an hypotesis is false.

To test the hypotesis we need to:

- Fix the level of significance $\alpha$
- Select the statistical testo to perform
- Perform the test
- Decide about the hypotesis

The significance level $\alpha$ is what determines if we accept or reject our hypotesis.

#### Presentation & packaging

We need to report all the steps that we made for our project and create a package taht contains everything in order to be replicated
