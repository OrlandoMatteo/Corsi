## Reference
[SLR](03-SLR.pdf)

## What

It's a method to **evaluate** and **interpreting** all the available studies on a given subject, a **rigorous** and **replicable** methodology shoould be used in order to obtain a fair **result**. 

Charachteristic of SLR:

- Give the predefined objective or our research
- Explicit how it was made
- Identify studies that belongs to some criteria of eligibility
- Evaluate each study
- Synthesis of the characteristics we found in the studies

The studyes analyzed are called **primary studies**, the SLR are called **secondary studies**, SLR of SLR is called **tertiary studies**.

## Motivation

### Why

Most research **should** start with a systematic literature review to sysntetize the existing works in a fair way, we've to avoid that our opinions distort the result of the research

### How

The first thing to do is to obtain the paper to be analyzed in order to have a complete overview. In order to have a fair research we must include also article that does not support the research hypotesis.

### What for 

We do this to different possible reasons:

- summarize existing evidence of some treatment or technology
- identify gaps in a research area so suggest further investigation
- provide a framework to position new research activities
- examine if some evidence support or contradicts some theoretical hypotesis

### Pros & Cons

A well defined methodology avoid possible bias in the literature research. It can provides information on a wide range of studies. In case of quantitative studies we can combined the data and perform meta-analysis. The major disadvantage is the effor needed

## Key Elements

- Review protocol
- Search strategy
- Documentation
- Explicit criteria
- Information specification

## Other review studies

### Systematic mapping studies

The research question for this kind of studies is very broad. This alloows to analyze with a higher level of granularity. It also allows to identify evidentce or cluster of evidences and evidence deserts for some topics..

### Tertiary reviews

If there's already an high number of systematic reviews it is possible to produce a **tertiary** reviews whis is a sytematic review of systematic reviews.

## Review process

[Planning](#planning) :arrow_forward: Execution :arrow_forward: Process

The stages may appear sequential but is more like an **iteration** of them. Many activities that are initiated during the planning are refined during the execution.

### Planning

Identification of the need for a review :arrow_forward: Research question specification :arrow_forward: Review protocol developement.

Specifying a **research question** is the most important part of the SLR as they completely drive it. It must be significative and important for the pople involved in that topic and it must bring some novelties in that field: suggest techniques, propose changes, identify difference between common beliefs and reality. There are multiple question types:

- Define the effect of a technology
- Identify factor and risk of a technology
- Define the impact on cost and reliability of a given technology
- Cost/benefit evaluation

A review protocl specifies the criteria we used for the SLR in order to avoid any bias. Then we need to specify how we applied the criteria (see [pdf](03-SLR.pdf))
