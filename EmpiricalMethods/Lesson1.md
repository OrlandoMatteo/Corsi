## Context

Tenchonogy is not universally good or bad, it must be appropriate for a particural circumstance or problem.
There is a lack of models to analyze the processes and the products.
The quality imporvement process can be a mechanism for continuos improvement for:

- Experimantantion
- Packaging
- Reuse

## Characterize

### Project and environment

- People
- Problem
- Process
- Product
- Resource

The changes in the ecosystem of the experiment must be evalueated in order to check their influence

## Goals

Which is the product? Is it measurable? Is model-driven

## Chose Process

Chose the execution model according to:

- the context
- the environment
- their characteristicstheir goal

## Execute the model

It's important to reuse package experiences and collect the data in ana automatic way during the process. It's important to understand how to collect the data

## Analyze

Understand which is the main cause of possible errors. Evaluate if the test are covering all the scenarios. Predict and control the prediction made on the process. Motivate and improve the process and its result

## Package results

Define and refine the models

## Experience factory

Two main focuses : --software developement-- end --systematic learning--.

## EBSE Steps

It's important to evaluate the performance in order to check if the technology is suitable in that field.

## Emphirical methods>

### Hypotetic deductive model

- Observation
- Form a conjecture
- Deduce a prediction from that conjecture
- Test the prediction

In the essence the scientific methods must be followed.  
It is also important to understand the difference among qualitative and quantitative.

## Grounded theory

Intead of starting witha  theory start analyzing the data to find unexpected patterns to the create a theory
