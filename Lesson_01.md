# Lesson 1

Steepest step or first improvement: look for the best point in the local space.

Random mutation hil climbereare qute easy to implement are really useful. It's main problem is that it can stuck in local optima.

Simulated annealing can help to solve this issue but we pay in time to get better solution by allowing error at the beginning of the search and gradally reduce this probability.
